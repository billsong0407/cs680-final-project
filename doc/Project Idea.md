**Algorithmic Analysis of Local Dialects: identify dialects based on audio.**
- Approach 1: first use large language model to first identify the segments of the input audio corresponding to each word, then use methods like K-means Cluster or K nearest neighbours to classify the dialects. Finally, average out the classification of each words in an audio to classify the entire sentence.
- Approach 2: simply train a machine learning model to classify the audio.
- Dataset: can look for existing dataset. Otherwise, getting audio data from local news station can also be viable
- Distinguish from existing work: it should be easy to find some dialects where few or no researches have been performed on. Additionally, I doubt if approach 1 is something commonly used in NLP.

**AI-Enhanced Mental Health Support with Sentiment Analysis and Adaptive Responses**
Problem: Current chatbots and mental health apps often fail to adapt to users' changing emotions and contexts over time.
Proposed Solution: Build a conversational AI system that combines sentiment analysis (machine learning) with deep learning for adaptive response generation (e.g., GPT-based) in real-time. The system could track usersâ€™ emotional states over time and provide mental health support tailored to their needs.
Differentiation: By integrating adaptive responses based on sentiment analysis, this system would setting it apart from more static chatbot solutions.
